# Overview
It has been seen that people with diabetes for a long time can get several complications like heart disorder, kidney disease, nerve damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced if it is predicted early. So, this project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain features and parameters.
